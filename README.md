# Dimensionality Reduction and Classification Project 4

This project was done to fulfill the project 4 requirements for the course CISC 820 - Quantitative Foundations.

In this project, we experiment with the application of dimensionality reduction and classification methods in face recognition. Given a dataset of face images, which consists of 10 different images for each of the 40 different subjects, we use PCA to extract the eigenfaces and
use them in combination with linear classification methods for image reconstruction, face recognition, and face identification.


## Reproducing the Project

To reproduce this project, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cxc6160/Proj4_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Classification.git
   ```

### Make sure this is the working directory in matlab.
 
### Running the script:
Run `main.m` to produce results.
```bash
    main;
```

## Results 
Some of the plots and results can be found in the [Artifacts](./Artifacts/) folder.

## Docs
You can find our report and presentation slides inside [Docs](./Docs/) folder. 

## Python based Implementation of PCA
 We have also implemented the PCA part to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the images with different principal components using python which is inside the [Python based PCA Implementation](./Python%20based%20PCA%20Implementation/) folder.
